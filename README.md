# Read-wire

A script that runs on a linux machine (tested on Raspberry Pi Zero) and watches for a Kindle being connected via USB. It makes a copy of the clippings file from the kindle to the machine.

This is a helper script that allows the file to then be used for other applications. 

The benefit of using this over the amazon cloud service is that your device also contains highlights for books that you did not purchase via the amazon store.
